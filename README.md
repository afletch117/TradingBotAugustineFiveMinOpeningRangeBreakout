# TradingBotAugustineFiveMinOpeningRangeBreakout

A bot that will analyze over 8,000 stocks every morning before trading, then filter that list down to about 10 stocks to watch during trading,
then will buy any stocks that exhibit a 5 minute Opening Range Breakout, then will calculate a profit target, and stop loss,
and will execute which ever comes first.  All the while, gathering stock data every minute.

This bot uses QuantConnect's LEAN API.

This bot is incomplete, however I spent about 6 months learning LEAN, and writing this bot.
Working on this project really showed me the beauty and power of python.
